# Supervised Learning Projects

This folder contains machine learning projects that involve supervised learning techniques. In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, meaning the input comes with the correct output.

## Included Concepts
- Classification (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVM)
- Regression (e.g., linear regression, random forest regression)

## Projects
- **Titanic Survival Prediction**: Predicting survival of passengers using classification models.
- **House Price Prediction**: Estimating housing prices using regression models.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
