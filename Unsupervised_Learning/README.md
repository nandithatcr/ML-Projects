# Unsupervised Learning Projects

This folder contains machine learning projects that involve unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, the models work with unlabeled data to uncover hidden patterns or groupings.

## Included Concepts
- Clustering (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)

## Projects
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior using clustering.
- **Iris Dataset Clustering**: Clustering iris flower species without labels.
  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
